\section{Conclusion}
In summary, the obtained results reveal that Genetic Programming produced satisfactory outcomes, albeit with a slightly inferior performance compared to LSTM in terms of MAE. Despite LSTM's superior performance, the evolved mathematical expression might be favored for its simplicity and interpretability, particularly in scenarios where computational cost and efficiency are fundamental. It is crucial to note that this study exclusively utilized outdoor temperature, neglecting other parameters. Acknowledging the potential existence of intrinsic relationships among various weather parameters, future research endeavors should encompass a more comprehensive exploration of the search space to unearth improved solutions by exploiting the interdependencies within the complete set of weather data.
